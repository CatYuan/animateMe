# Final Project
**Animate Me**
* **Description of Project**:
    * Similar to a SnapChat filter. 
    * The program will use facial recognition to identify the user's face and overlay an animation over the face of the user. 
    * The user is then able to control this animation by moving their own face. The facial expressions of the animation should follow that of the users. Similarly, the position of the animation on the screen will follow that of the user as long as they are within the view of the camera.
